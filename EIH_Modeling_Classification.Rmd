# Introduction

It is well known that endurance performances are limited by physiological
factors among which the cardio-respiratory is one of the most important
(@amannConvectiveOxygenTransport2008, @bassettLimitingFactorsMaximum2000). This
system can be limiting through different ways including the limitations of the
cardiac output (Qc), the oxygen diffusion or the pulmonary perfusion. Those
limitations can be enhanced by physical training and physiological adaptations
to exercise. Thus with training we can observe an increased cardiac output,
pulmonary perfusion or oxygen diffusion through an increased hemoglobin
concentration.

It's also well known that the environment can impact the oxygen pressures and
thus the inspired volume. This limitation is also present during
experimentation, like simulated altitude, during which the inspired fraction of
oxygen is diminished.

If the cardiac system is one of the most known limiting, the pulmonary system
can also participated in the observed limitations. This system is complicated
and the pulmonary anatomy is composed by several "section". A known
physiopathology impact athlete's performances is the exercise-induces hypoxemia
(EIH) (@raberinHypoxemieInduiteExercice2019). The purpose of this work is to be
able to classify athletes as EIH or NEIH without using the direct indicator
(saturation).
